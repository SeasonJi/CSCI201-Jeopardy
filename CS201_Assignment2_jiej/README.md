There is a small error for final jeopardy part. If we click each team's "submit" buttons after they all have entered answers, the submit button will just clear the next JTextField next to it and the program cannot get and compare the each team's reply with the real answer. This is so weird and I just do not know how to fix it. So please submit each team's answer right after you enter this team's answer. (And hopefully this will not hurt my score ;(.  )
